Aim: How do conditional statements work in java?

Do Now: Write a simple java program that tests the following:
	String a = new String("Hello");
	String b = new String("Hello");

	System.out.println( a == b );


Object comparison:
	You cannot use >, <, >=, <= on object variables

	== and != will check to see if two object variables refer to the same
	piece of memory, not if they have the same "value"

	Many classes (including Strings), have an equals method that can check
	for


		&& and
		|| or
		!  not

Conditional Statements
	if ( <BOOLEAN> ) {
		<RESULT 1>
	}
	else if ( <BOOLEAN> ) {
		<RESULT 2>
	}
	...
	else {
		<FINAL RESULT>
	}

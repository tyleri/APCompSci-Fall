Aim: What are Interfaces?


Interfaces

	A java interface allows multiple classes to share
	the same method behavior.
	
	Interfaces can only contain abstract methods
	and constants.

	Interfaces can be variable types but cannot
	be object types.

Comparable
	java interface that contains a single method

	public int compareTo( Object o );

	a.compareTo(b) returns:
		0 if a == b
		some negative number if a < b
		some positive number if a > b

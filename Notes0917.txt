Java Class Anatomy

	Protection
		Access to classes, variables and methods is
		is determined by their protection.

		There are three kinds of protection:
			public
				Can be used by any java class

			private
				Can only used by the class itself

			protected
				Can be used by the class itself and all
				subclasses

		Identifiers
			class, method and variable names are called
			Identifiers

			Can only be made of letters (upper and
			lower case), numbers, _ and $

			Cannot start with a number

		Template java class
			<class header> {

				<instance variables>

				<methods>
			}

			class header
				<protection> class <classname>

				classname
					By convention, class names start with
					a capital letter and use camel case
						ex: Greeter
						    MyAwesomeClass

		instance variable
			<protection> <type> <name>

			name
				By convention, variable names start
				with a lower case letter and use camel
				case
					example: x
					    myString


			type
				All variables must have an associated type

				The type can either be a primitive
				datatype (like int) or any java class

					example: int x;
					    Greeter g;

		method header
			<protection> <return type> <name>(<parameters>)

			name
				Like variable names, method names usually
				start with a lower case letter and use
				camel case

			parameters
				Parameters must be given a type and a name
				like any other variable

				Multiple parameters are separated by ,

				example: (int x, int y, String s)

			return type
				If a method returns a value, you must
				declare what kind of value is returned

				If a method does not return a value,
				then the return type should be void

			Two or more methods in the same class can have
			the same name as long as they do not have the
			same parameters. This is known as OVERLOADING
			methods.

				public int foo()
				public int foo(String s)
					foo() is overloaded correctly


	main method
		Each class can (but doesn't have to contain a method called
		main.

		main is special, it is the only method that is run
		automatically

			$ java Hello
			will run the main method inside the class Hello

		The main method must have the following header:
			public static void main(String[] args)

			static is a special keyword that modifies how a method
			works.

Creating Objects
	In order to create an object (instance of a class), you must call a
	special method known as the CONSTRUCTOR.

	By default, all java classes have at least 1 constructor.

	The name of a constructor is always the name of the class itself.

Aim: How do we get text input?


Text input during your program:
	Scanner
		Java class to get input from the terminal or files

		Scanner can = new Scanner( System.in );
		can.next();
			This will make your program wait until the
			user has typed something and hit return

			Returns what the user entered, as a string.

		can.nextInt(), nextDouble() ...
			Works like next but returns an int, double...

			If the user enters the wrong type, an error
			occurs

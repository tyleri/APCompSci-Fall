Boolean Short Circuiting

	Java will evaluate compound boolean statements
	left to right.

	Java will stop evaluating compound boolean
	statements once there is sufficient information
	to get the value.

	example
		a > b && c == d
			If a > b is false, then c == d will not
			be evaluated

		x != y || w < z
			If x != y is true, then w < z will not
			be evaluated

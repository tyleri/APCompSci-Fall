Aim: How do we extend classes?

extends
	Java keyword used to create a subclass
		example: public class Mage extends Character

	You cannot extend more than one class

	There is no limit to the levels of subclasses that
	can be made.

	Subclasses inherit all instance variables and methods
	except for constructors (more on that later).

	private instance variables in a superclass are
	inherited by subclasses, but cannot be accessed by
	the subclass.

	The PROTECTED keyword makes instance variables
	accessible by a class and its subclasses

Method inheritance

	Subclasses can create their own version of inherited
	methods, this is known as overriding a method (think
	about toString)

	You can call the superclass's version of a method with
	the SUPER keyword.

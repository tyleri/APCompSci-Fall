Aim: What should be in our java toolbox?


Do now: What text editors have you used (for programming or otherwise)?
Discuss them with your neighbors.

- gedit
- notepad++
- TextMate
- Vim
- TextWrangler
- TextEdit
- Notepad
- Sublime
- Komodo Edit
- Emacs


Programming Tools
	Text Editor
		Basic tool for writing code.
		Programming text editors will have many useful
		programming features, like syntax highlighting,
		automatic tabbing, autocompletion, etc.


	Compiler

	Interpreter

	IDE
		Integrated Development Environment
		Designed to handle all your programming needs.
		IDEs will contain a text editor as well as an
		interpreter/compiler for the language.
		IDEs are language specific

Java Tools
	javac
		The Java compiler.
		Basic operation:
			$javac <java source>
			$javac foo.java
				Will create foo.class

	java
		The Java virtual machine (JVM)
		The JVM allows your compiled java code to run on
		any computer that has java. This is called being
		cross-platform.
		Each platform (computer hardware + OS) has a
		specific JVM.
		The JVM sits between your compiled java files and
		your computer hardware, allowing any java compiled
		file to run on any computer.

		Basic operation
			$ java <java binary>
			$ java foo
				Will only work if foo.class exists

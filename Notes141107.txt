Aim: How does type casting work?

Do Now: Create a java program with a main method with a
		variable for each primitive type (except for
		boolean).

Type Casting
	Using a value as a type other than its declared type.

	All primitives (except for booleans) can be type cast
	to one of the other primitive types.

	Type casting cannot change a variable

	syntax:
		(<NEW TYPE>)<VALUE/VARIABLE>
		(double)4
		(int)13.8
		(short)x

	An object variable can be typecast to its object type or
	any type above it in a class hierarchy.

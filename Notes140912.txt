Aim: What does a java program look like?

Do Now: Log in, open a terminal and use emacs to write the
	simple java program we say at the end of class
	yesterday. Then try to compile and run it!

In case you missed it:


public class Hello {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Good News Everyone!");
	}
}

Java Syntax Basics:
	Java is case sensitive!

	The class name must match the file name
		ex. Hello.java mustt define a class called Hello

	Regular statements must end in a ;

	Code blocks are contained inside {}
		{ replaces l at the end of a line that starts a code block

		} sets the end of the code block

		Examples of code blocks
			Method bodies
			Class bodies
			Conditional (if, else...) statement results
			Looping processes.

	Comments
		// can be used to comment a single line
			ex. //This will print to the command line
			System.out.println("boo"); //scary

		/* .. */ can be used to comment multiple lines

Aim: How do we work with arrays?

Array

	The simplest java data structure

	A contiguous block of memory used to store multiple
	values of the same type.

	Arrays have a fixed size
		An array can be re-initialized to a new size, but
		that will erase all the data stored in it.

	Each element in an array will contain the default value
	for the array's data type until modified.

	Array syntax basics:

		int[] ray;  //Array declaration
		    ^
		    | Denote ray is an array of ints

		ray = new int[10];  //Array initialization
			       ^
			       |  Sets the size of the array

		ray.length; //Returns the size of the array

	[]s are used to access values in an array.

		ray[0] = 75;

		ray[i] words, but 0 <= i < ray.length

	Initializer lists
		
		Used to create an array with preset values

		char[] cray = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };

		This will create a 3 character array with the
		values 'a', 'b', and 'c'

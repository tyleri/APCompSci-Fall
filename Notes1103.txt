Aim: How can we make arrays better?

Do Now: Write down some limitations of arrays.

- Fixed size
- Can only hold 1 type
- Cannot have negative indices
- Cannot just append a value
- Cannot get the index of a given value

SuperArray
Instance var(s): Object[]

We can make an "improved" array by making a class that adds
this functionality. How would this "Super Array" work?

SuperArray:
	Instance Variables?
		Object[] data
		int size

	Methods
		default constructor
		size based constructor
		copy
		insert: add anywhere
		append: add at the end
		concatenate
		resize

Aim: 

Method inheritance

	To call a superclass constructor, use super by itself
		ex. super(); or super("dude"); ....

	Constructors are not inherited, but java automatically
	assumes the first line of a constructor is a call to
	the superclass's default constructor, unless you
	explicitly call a different superclass constructor.


Object class
	All classes are subclasses of Object unless they
	explicitly extend a different class

	The Object class contains a few basic methods such as:
		.toString
		.equals
		default constructor

Variable type vs. Object type

	Variable type
		The type declared in your code.
			String s ==> Variable type is String
			Object o ==> Variable type is Object
			Mage m   ==> Variable type is Mage

		Variables can only use methods that are defined in
		their variable type class.

	Object type
		The type created in memory.
		Tied to which constructor was used to create the
		object.

		String s = new String() ==> Object type is String
		Object o = new Object() ==> Object type is Object
		Mage m = new Mage() ==> Object type is Mage

	Variables can refer to any object type that is at or
	below the variable type in a class hierarchy.

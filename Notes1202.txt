Aim: How can we keep ArrayLists in order?


Do Now: Consider a data structure that words like an
		ArrayList but is always in sorted order.
		Assume this class has a single instance
		variable, an ArrayList. What must be
		different between this data structure and a
		regular ArrayList?
		

- add(value) needs to maintain order
- set needs to maintain order
	- don't have a set method
- add(index, value) is not usable
- values need to be compareable

Write OrderedArrayList, a class that has one
instance variable:

	private ArrayList<Integer> data;

It should contain methods to insert, remove and
retrieve ints from data while ensuring that data is
always sorted.

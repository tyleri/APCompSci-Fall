Aim: How do conditional statements work in Java?

Do Now: Pick a language (not java) and perform the following tasks

	1) Find the product of 4 and 6
	2) Find the remainder of 105 / 6
	3) Add 1 to a variable x

Note on operators in java
	Arithmetic operators
		+, -, *, /, %

			%: mod operator (remainder)

			Division is dependant on the types used!

				<integer> / <integer> ==> <integer>

				Integer division truncates the value, no
				rounding occurs.

				All other combinations will result in a
				floating point type.

				11 / 2 ==> 5
				11 / 2.0 ==> 5.5

		+=, -=, *=, /=, %=
			Compound assignment operators
			x+=y <==> x = x + y

		++, --
			Increment/decrement operators
			The same as adding/subtracting 1 to a variable

			int x = 4;
			x++; // x becomes 5

			x++ means return x and then add 1 to it
			++x means add 1 to x and then return it

		
	Comparison operators
		>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
			Return boolean values
			!= inequality

	Boolean operators
		&& and
		|| or
		!  not

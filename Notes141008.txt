Aim: What's up with that static thing anyway?

Do Now:
	1) Open your Rational Number class (any
	version is fine)
	2) Add a method called toString, it should
	return a string representation of the object.
	3) In main, create a Rational Number object
	and print out the object variable directly.


toString
	Returns a String representation of an object.
	Java will automatically call toString whenever
	you use an object variable in a String context.

	Every class has a toString method (just like a
	default constructor, and equals). The default
	toString method will return the class name and
	the memory location of the object.

	toString should have the following header:

		public String toString()

	If you write your own toString, it will
	replace the one java creates for you.

		RationalNumber r = new RationalNumber(8, 34);
		System.out.println(r); // will call r.toString();

static

	Static methods are class methods that are not
	attached to a specific object.

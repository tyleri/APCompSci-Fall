Aim: How can we use 2-dimensional arrays?

Do Now: Write a java program that does the following:
	(you only need a main method)

	Create a 4x3 2-d array of ints that contain the
	numbers 0-11 in order without the use of an extra
	(non for loop related) counter variable.

	Print out the array to test out your work.

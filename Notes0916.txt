Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

	An OOP program is a collection of objects

	The properties of an object are defined in a class

		A Class is a blueprint for all objects of the same type.

		An object is a specific instance of a class

		An object has 2 parts

			1) Instance Variables: Things the object "knows"
			2) Methods: Things the object "does"

		Instance variables are declared at the top of a class,
		before any methods.

			You must declare any variables before you use it.
			Variable declaration includes a name and type.

Java Class Anatomy

	Protection
		Access to classes, variables and methods is
		is determined by their protection.

		There are three kinds of protection:
			public
				Can be used by any java class

			private
				Can only used by the class itself

			protected
				Can be used by the class itself and all
				subclasses

		Identifiers
			class, method and variable names are called
			Identifiers

			Can only be made of letters (upper and
			lower case), numbers, _ and $

			Cannot start with a number

		Template java class
			<class header> {

				<instance variables>

				<methods>
			}

			class header
				<protection> class <classname>

				classname
					By convention, class anmes start with
					a capital letter and use camel case
						ex: Greeter
						    MyAwesomeClass

			instance variable
				<protection> <type> <name>

				name
					By convention, variable names start
					with a lower case letter and use camel
					case
						example: x
						    myString


				type
					All variables must have an associated type

					The type can either be a primitive
					datatype (like int) or any java class

						example: int x;
						    Greeter g;

			method header
				<protection> <return type>
				<name>(<parameters>)

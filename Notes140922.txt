Aim: What are the Java primitive data types?

Do Now: List the different types of data you have worked with programming in
other languages.

Strings
Lists
Dictionaries
Floating points

Using variables
	Creating and using a variable takes two steps,
	declaration and initialization.

	Declaring a variable states what kind of type it is.
		example: int x;
			 String s;
			 Greeter g;

	Initialization gives a variable an initial value
		example: x = -24;
			 s = "Hello";
			 g = new Greeter();

	Declaration and initialization can be done on a single line
		example: int x = -24;
			 String s = "Hello";
			 Greeting g = new Greeter();

Primitive Data Types
	The only data types that are not classes

	Type		Name	Size(bits)	Range
	Integers	Byte	8		[-128,127]
			short	16		[-2^15, 2^15 - 1]
			int	32		[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]
			long	64		[-2^63, 2^63 - 1]

	Floating	float	32		7 digits of precision
	points		double	64		14 digits of precision
	character	char	16
	boolean		boolean	?		True or False

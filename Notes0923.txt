Aim: How do we write our own constructors?

Do Now: What is the smallest variable type that could be used to store the
following values

	1) 5
	2) -30,000
	3) 255
	4) 5,000,000,000

Answers:
	1) byte
	2) short
	3) short
	4) long

Default Values
	If a variable is not initialized it is given a default value.

	All numeric primitives are set to 0

	boolean primitives are set to false

	Characters are set to '' (empty/null characters)

	Strings are set to "" (empty/null string)

	All object variables are set to null (nothing)

Constructor
	Java creates a default constructor for every class.

		The default constructor takes no parameters and will set all
		instance variables to their default values.

	You can write your own constructors using this header:

		<protection> <class name>(<parameters>)

	Constructors can be private or protected, but are most often public.

	public Greeter() {
		message = "Hello";
	}

	public Greeter( String m ) {
		message = m;
	}
